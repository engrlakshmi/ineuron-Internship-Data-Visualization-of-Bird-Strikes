Problem statement
A bird strike is specifically described as a collision between a bird and an aircraft that is in flight or rolling out for takeoff or landing. The term is frequently broadened to include other wildlife strikes involving bats or ground creatures. Bird strikes are frequent and can pose a serious risk to the security of aeroplanes. Smaller aircraft may sustain considerable structural damage, and all aircraft, especially those powered by jet engines, are susceptible to the loss of thrust that can occur when birds are ingested by the engine air intakes. Several of these mishaps have been fatal as a result.
Any phase of flight may experience bird strikes, but due to the higher density of birds in flight at lower altitudes, the takeoff, initial ascent, approach, and landing phases are the most frequent. Recently an American Airlines Boeing 737-800 performing flight from chicago to Kansas sity was descending on the arrival when a flock of geese hit the aircraft causing severe damage to the nose and leading edges of wings taking out probes affecting cockpit indications. The data gathered on bird strikes by the FAA between 2000 and 2011 is visually represented in the following PDF if you want a deeper look.
